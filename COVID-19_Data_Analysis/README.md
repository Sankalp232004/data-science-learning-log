Our World in Data - COVID-19 Analysis ðŸ¦ 
This project provides an analysis of global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, focusing on key metrics like cases and deaths. The analysis uses Python with the Pandas library for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization. The primary goal is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic over time.

Dataset Overview ðŸ“‹
The dataset is a comprehensive record of COVID-19 statistics spanning multiple years and countries. It contains 350,085 entries and 67 columns, providing a rich but complex source of information.

Key Observations
Data Size: The DataFrame is large, with over 350,000 rows, indicating a vast amount of time-series data for numerous locations.

Data Types: The core columns like date, iso_code, continent, and location are correctly identified as object or int64. The date column, however, will need to be converted to a proper datetime format to perform time-series analysis.

Missing Values: A significant challenge in this dataset is the high number of missing values across many columns. The initial check revealed:

continent: 16,665 missing values.

total_cases: 37,997 missing values.

excess_mortality and related columns: Over 337,000 missing values, suggesting this data is available for only a small subset of the entries.

Many other columns related to hospital data, testing, and vaccinations also have a high number of nulls.

Analysis and Visualizations ðŸ“ˆ
The initial steps of this project involved:

Data Cleaning: Missing values were identified. For instance, the total_cases column's missing values were filled with 0 to enable numerical operations.

Time-Series Analysis: The date column was converted to a proper datetime format.

Visualization: A line chart was created to visualize the trend of total COVID-19 cases in a specific country (India) over time. This visualization is a crucial first step in understanding the pandemic's trajectory in a particular region.
