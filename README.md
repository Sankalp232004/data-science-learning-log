Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains two beginner-friendly data analysis projects built using Python, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.

📁 1. Titanic Project
Goal:
To explore the Titanic dataset and identify the factors that affected passenger survival.

Dataset:
Kaggle’s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Key Tasks:

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering (e.g., Title extraction from names)

Visualization using matplotlib

Logistic regression model (optional)

Main Insights:

Gender, age, and passenger class were major factors in survival

Families traveling together had different outcomes

Cabin data had hidden patterns when cleaned properly

📁 2. Retail Project
Goal:
To analyze sales data from a fictional retail store and find trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

Dataset:
Superstore Sales Dataset

Key Tasks:

Data cleaning (removing duplicates, fixing data types)

Profit and sales trend analysis

Region-wise and category-wise performance

Time series patterns in order dates

Identifying high and low-performing segments

Main Insights:

West region had the highest sales, but Central had higher profits

Technology and Office Supplies were top-performing categories

Some discount levels hurt profits significantly
