Indian Startup Funding Analysis ðŸ’°
This project analyzes funding details of Indian startups from a downloaded CSV file. It uses Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. The analysis focuses on understanding funding trends, key investment types, and geographical distribution of startups.

Dataset Overview ðŸ“‹
The dataset contains 3044 entries with details on Indian startups. The initial data exploration revealed the following:

Key Columns & Data Types
Amount in USD: The funding amount is stored as an object (string) and has 960 missing values. This column requires significant cleaning to be converted to a numeric type for calculations.

City Location: The city where the startup is located, with 180 missing values. The column name initially contained extra spaces, which were cleaned for consistency.

Date dd/mm/yyyy: The date of funding is an object and will need to be converted to a proper datetime format for time-series analysis.

Industry Vertical & SubVertical: These columns, describing the startup's sector, have 171 and 936 missing values respectively.

InvestmentnType: The type of funding round (e.g., Seed, Angel) has 4 missing values.

Data Cleaning Performed
Column Names: All column names were cleaned to remove leading/trailing whitespace and standardize spacing (e.g., 'City  Location' became 'City Location').

Categorical Data: Values in the City Location and InvestmentnType columns were standardized to fix inconsistencies and typos (e.g., 'Bangalore' to 'Bengaluru').

Missing Values: The number of missing values for each column was identified. These will be handled with appropriate methods in future analysis steps.

Initial Findings and Visualizations ðŸ“Š
The initial analysis focused on the geographical distribution of startups. A bar chart was created to visualize the top 10 cities with the most funded startups, which is a great starting point for understanding where India's startup ecosystem is most concentrated.
